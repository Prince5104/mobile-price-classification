# mobile-price-classification
End-to-end ML project to predict mobile phone price range using logistic regression, SVM, and Random Forest
# ðŸ“± Mobile Price Range Classification

This is an end-to-end machine learning classification project to predict mobile phone price range (0â€“3) based on features like RAM, battery power, internal memory, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Performed EDA using boxplots and pairplots
- Tried multiple models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Achieved **97.5% accuracy** with Logistic Regression

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ”® Result Summary

| Model               | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 97.5%    |
| SVM (Tuned)          | 92.75%   |
| Random Forest        | 89.2%    |

âœ… Logistic Regression performed the best on this dataset.
